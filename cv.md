# About Me
I am 36 years old and work as a system administrator. I think that my real work has become very monotonous and doesn't give me any further room for development. I really need classes in which I can develop throughout my life. That's why I'm here. My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development.

* **My strengths:**
    * Quick learner
    * Full immersion in the essence of the problems
    * Diligence
    * Team playing

> **Keep learning...**
